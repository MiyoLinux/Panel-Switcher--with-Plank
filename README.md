Requires: python 2, tint2, lxpanel, xfce4-panel, plank

The Panel Switcher allows a user to choose between three panels...Tint2, LXPanel, or Xfce4 Panel. In this version, Plank is used as the Dock. The Openbox autostart file is automatically overwritten to start the chosen panel/dock at the next logout/login or reboot.
